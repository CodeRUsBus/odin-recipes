    <h2>The Mac & Cheese that your husband dreams of</h2>
    <p>Heavy on smoky gouda and dripping with creaminess, this Gouda 
        Mac & Cheese is the perfect mac combo. Above all, the best part 
        about this mac and cheese recipe is there's no need for overly 
        expensive cheeses.  Just pick three or four of the one's you 
        love and create the perfect one for you.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dry macaroni pasta</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded cheese, plus 1 cup for baked topping if 
            desired (gouda, white cheddar, parmesan, and Velveeta is 
            my go-to combination; 1 cup of each)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cup whole milk (or half and half)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil macaroni.</strong> Boil pasta per package instructions, reserve 
            1 cup pasta water, then drain. </li>
        <li><strong>Make cheese sauce.</strong> In the same or large pot, melt 1/2 cup 
            (1 stick) butter over medium heat. Whisk in 4 tbsp all-purpose 
            flour, and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Pour in 
            2 cups milk and 1 cup heavy cream, then stir occasionally 
            on high heat until the mixture thickens.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine macaroni & cheese.</strong> Fold in 4 cups shredded cheese, 
            1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp 
            garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp paprika. Melt the cheeses into 
            a smooth sauce, whisking to break up lumps, about 3 minutes. 
            If the sauce is too thick, pour in some pasta water to 
            loosen the cheese sauce. Turn off the heat. Stir in the cooked macaroni. </li>
        <li><strong>Optional - Bake.</strong>  If you like your macaroni with a 
            cheesy baked crust, pour the cooked mac & cheese into a 
            baking dish. Top with 1 cup extra shredded cheese. Bake at 
            375ยบ F for 10-15 minutes until golden brown and bubbly on 
            top. In the last 2 minutes, broil the top for a great crust, 
            but watch it carefully to avoid burning! Enjoy warm! </li>
    </ol>
