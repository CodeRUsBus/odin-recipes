        <li>2 cups of water</li>
        <li>28 oz canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>16 oz canned kidney beans (drain them, rinse them, and mash)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot with medium head. Add turkey and

        <li>Bring mixture to a boil.  Reduce heat to low.  Then allow chili to simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool, and Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
